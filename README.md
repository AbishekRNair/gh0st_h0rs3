i opened the file ghost.log which had many inputs like (1724973000.261710) vcan0 5DC#A4130414E3D4557A 
i searched about it in chat gpt and got to know about the VCAN id so i googled ford car vcan id and opened the  first link
In contents i found  Ford (Lincoln, Mercury)
In it i found Ford Mustang S550 and got its rpm can id then i opened it in directory and used the grep command to search all the vcan id 
i got total 9 vcan id and then one by one i converted the hexadecimal format to ascii format and
got the flag in just 1st four vcan id
